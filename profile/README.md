# Welcome to Global Health Engineering üåç

We are a [research group](https://ghe.ethz.ch/) at ETH Z√ºrich that focuses on the systems and technologies that can help improve all aspects of health in over-exploited countries and populations.

## Code

We are committed to Open Science, a movement aiming to make scientific research more accessible, inclusive, and transparent. In this repository, you'll find hardware designs, software, data packages, among many other outputs.  Most of them are licensed under CC-BY 4.0, meaning you have the right to share and adapt our materials, even commercially, as long as you give us credit.

## Open Student Projects

If you are a student (Bachelors, Masters) and interested in working with us on a thesis or semester project, please send an email including:

- current CV, including language and country experience
- research interests including at least one well-defined research question
- the proposed timeline of your research project

Open positions for Bachelor and Master Thesis Projects are published on the SiROP platform. For a list of open opportunities, please see below. You can also apply directly through the platform including the details mentioned above.

The semester projects are most probably not listed below. If you are looking for one, don't hesitate to contact us:
