# Welcome to Global Health Engineering! üåç

Our research focuses on the systems and technologies that can help improve all aspects of health in over-exploited countries and populations.

While the field of Global Health seeks to address the drivers and outcomes of well-being for international populations from a medical or epidemiological perspective, [Global Health Engineering](https://ghe.ethz.ch/) addresses determinants of health as a function of engineered interventions and systems. Our work looks at ways of reducing the negative impacts of modern life, particularly in urban areas of over-exploited countries. Our research seeks to reduce the negative impacts of improperly managed human, organic, and anthropogenic waste while ensuring that solutions are affordable, effective, and acceptable to users.
